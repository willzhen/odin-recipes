                    <li>1 Tbsp instant yeast</li>

                    <li>57g unsalted butter (melted)</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>To make the tangzhong:</strong> Combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain.</li>
                <li>Place the saucepan over low heat and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until thick and the whisk leaves lines on the bottom of the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer the tangzhong to a small mixing bowl or measuring cup and let it cool to lukewarm.</li>
                <li><strong>To make the dough:</strong> Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine the tangzhong with the remaining dough ingredients,
                     then mix and knead — by mixer or bread machine — until a smooth, elastic dough forms; this could take almost 15 minutes in a stand mixer.</li>
                <li>Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased bowl, covered, for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.</li>
                <li>Gently deflate the dough and divide it into four equal pieces; if you have a scale each piece will weigh between 170g and 175g.</li>
                <li>Flatten each piece of dough into a 5" x 8" rectangle, then fold the short ends in towards one another like a letter. Flatten the folded pieces into rectangles 
                    again (this time about 3" x 6") and, starting with a short end, roll them each into a 4" log.</li>
                <li>Place the logs in a row of four — seam side down and side by side — in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan.</li>
                <li>Cover the loaf and allow it to rest/rise for 40 to 50 minutes, until puffy.</li>
                <li>Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
                <li><strong>To bake the bread:</strong> Brush the loaf with milk and bake it for 30 to 35 minutes, until it's golden brown on top and a digital thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 190°F.</li>
                <li>Remove the loaf from the oven and cool it in the pan until you can transfer it safely to a rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
